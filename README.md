# Home Lab
This repository is dedicated to the setup of my home lab. This whole thing is built on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). Along with everything managed by [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/).
```

## Features
This lab is constantly growing so this is bound to change but as of right now here is what I have:
  - [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) - Portainer is what is used to manage everything Docker in one easy place
  - [Homarr](https://homarr.dev/) - Homarr is my main dashboard due to is flexability
  - [UptimeKuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) - UptimeKuma is what I use to track all my API's and websites
